=========

This project has been created by HCL Tech System Software team to support the installation automation of OpenStack using SaltStack.

# Objective of the Project

This open source project is based on to support the automation of installation of OpenStack (for Liberty release on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) using SaltStack version 2016.3.2, the installation gets completed in very short span of time. 
SaltStack provides an infrastructure management framework which makes task of installation pretty easier. SaltStack maintains a repository of formulas (which are plain sls files having information about steps involved in installation/execution). These sls files contain definite set of formulas for installation and configuration of different OpenStack packages.
